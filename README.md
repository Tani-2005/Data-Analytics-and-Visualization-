# About my project
This Python code develops an interactive data dashboard using Dash and Plotly, designed to visualize and analyze key aspects of a dataset related to insurance claims. The dashboard includes multiple visualizations that allow users to explore the distribution and relationships of different features within the dataset. The primary visualizations included are:
1.	Line Graph for a Single Feature: A line graph is generated for the feature PREAUTH_AMT (or any other chosen feature) plotted against the index, allowing for the identification of trends and patterns over the dataset. This is particularly useful for visualizing how a specific feature varies across different data points in a sequential manner.
2.	Pie Chart for Target Variable Distribution: A pie chart is created to display the distribution of the target variable AGE, providing an overview of the proportions of different age categories within the dataset. This allows for quick insights into how the target variable is spread across the dataset.
3.	Scatter Plot for Two Features: A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between two continuous features, PREAUTH_AMT and CLAIM_AMOUNT. The points are color-coded based on the target variable AGE, providing a clear representation of how these features are related and how the target variable might influence their distribution.
4.	Bar Graph for Age Distribution: A bar graph visualizes the frequency distribution of the AGE feature, displaying the count of occurrences for each unique age category. This helps to quickly assess how many entries fall into each age group and provides a simple yet effective way to analyze categorical data.
5.	Histogram for Feature Distribution: A histogram is generated to display the distribution of the AGE feature, with the dataset divided into bins. This visualization allows users to observe how AGE is distributed across the entire dataset, revealing insights about the frequency and spread of values within specific ranges.
6.	Random Forest Classifier for Prediction: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a Random Forest Classifier model is trained to predict the target variable AGE. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and other classification metrics, providing an indication of how well the model can predict age categories based on other input features.
7.	Dash Application Layout: All these visualizations are incorporated into a Dash app layout, making the entire analysis interactive. Users can explore different aspects of the dataset through the graphical representations, allowing them to better understand the relationships between variables, identify trends, and gain insights into the predictions made by the model. The interactivity and integration of machine learning make the dashboard an effective tool for data exploration and decision-making.
This approach not only provides powerful visual insights into the data but also combines the use of machine learning to predict outcomes, giving users a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. By integrating statistical visualizations and predictive modeling, this code serves as an example of how to analyze and visualize data in a meaningful and interactive way.
